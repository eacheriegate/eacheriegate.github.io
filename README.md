## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! 🌏🔭🌱

I am just a human with an insatiable curiosity ~ and a penchant for research using satellite imagery and GIS at the nexus of water, climate, and ecology.

Many of my projects are in development for upcoming publications. Updates coming soon! Take a look at my [portfolio](https://eacheriegate.github.io) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eacheriegate/) for the latest updates.

Languages/tools I work with: R, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS (Pro/Online), QGIS, Jupyter, AWS.
